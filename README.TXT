HERE ARE SOME GUIDELINES THAT WILL MAKE IT EASY FOR YOU TO RUN THE CODE.
ADD ALL THESE FILES IN A FOLDER. GO TO THAT FOLDER USING COMMAND PROMPT AND EXECUTE AS INSTURCTED BELOW.

1) IN YOUR MYSQL CLIENT, EXECUTE "createdb.sql";

This will create the schema in mysql. You will need to use following command on mysql command line client >> source <full path of the file createdb.sql>. Here after, everything will be done on windows cmd.

2) Run compile_populate.bat and run_populate.bat

The data should get populated in our schema.

3) Next, run compile_hw.bat

4) Now you can run any of the given 4 queries using .bat files provided. You can change the arguments by editing the .bat files and then run them again.

NOTE: THE PROGRAM WAS TESTED ON WINDOWS 10 COMMAND PROMPT AND MYSQL WORKBENCH 8.0.
IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES RUNNING THE CODE, PLEASE SEND ME AN EMAIL WHICH IS PROVIDED ABOVE.
